<h2>1st Favorite</h2> 
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<img src="https://www.endurancewarranty.com/learning-center/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fast-and-Furious-Posters.jpg" width="350px">
<p> This is my favorite movie because it has a lot of action as well as a lot of cars and the cast is amazing!<br>
They have 7 Fast and Furious movies made so far and they are all really good and they all relate to each other somehow; so in a way it's one amazing long movie.
They are also going to make 8th in 2017.<br>
